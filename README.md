# Image Generator

Simple app in node.js to create images with the Open-AI image api
Really just trying to use Dall-e for free :)

## To run the app

1. $ npm install       to install dependencies
2. Add a .env file and insert your own api key from Open-AI
3. $ node app.js       to start the app
4. Then follow the instructions in the terminal

When image(s) are generated remove them before running the app again
